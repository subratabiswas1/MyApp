Description of the App
•	In this Data Visualisation App the number of inputs given by the user is dynamic so any no of inputs is being shown on the Graph properly. 

•	At Home Page I am taking two inputs one for the ‘username’ and the other one for ‘expenses’ so that we can plot it on x-y plane

•	After pressing ‘Add Data’ the inputData will be stored and being shown below with a operation ‘Delete’ that can be done anytime by the user

•	On pressing ‘Clear’ button the data on the input boxes will be empty. On pressing ‘generate graph’ the page will navigate to the next page that is ‘Data Visualisation’ where it will show the BarChart according to the dataset

•	For using BarChart I have used a library called ‘react-native-chart-kit’ and gave some styling configurations for better user interface

•	I have also added ‘Dark Mode’ button on the right top corner
